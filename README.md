- this is the source code of <a href="http://youareanidiot.org/">youareanidiot.org/</a> from 2004-2009.<br>
- before 2010, when you went to <a href="http://youareanidiot.org/">youareanidiot.org/</a> and then backed-out-of/closed the tab, you were greeted with <b>the meaning of life</b> (windows flying around your screen with a .SWF file flashing, displaying "you are an idiot!" while singing beautifully about the fact that you are an idiot).<br>
- but now the windows flying around the screen doesn't happen anymore if you go to the original site. :(<br>
- soooooooo i dug around a bit on the <a href="https://archive.org/web/">way back machine</a> and gathered this source code to put in this repository.<br>
↓<b>read this if you want to worry about other things↓</b><br>
- upon downloading the source code folder to your computer, your antivirus will probably remove the download due to the "you.js" file within the download.<br>
<b><i>if you're not looking for complications!:</i></b><br>
you could just download <i><b>only</b></i> the "you-are-an-idiot-virus.html" file which sources all the other files from this repository <br>
<b>(see "source-code/readme.md" for more information on the source code)</b>
