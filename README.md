# READ THIS!
- this is the source code of <a href="http://youareanidiot.org/">youareanidiot.org/</a> from 2004-2009.<br>
- before 2010, when you wen't to <a href="http://youareanidiot.org/">youareanidiot.org/</a> and then backed-out-of/closed the tab, you were greeted with <b>the meaning of life</b> (windows flying around your screen with a flash video singing beautifully to you about the fact that you are an idiot).

<b>source-code:</b><br>
upon donnloading the source code folder to your computer, your antivirus will probably remove the download due to the "you.js" file within the download.<br>
<br>
<b><i>if you're not loocking for complications!:</i></b><br>
you could just download <i><b>only</b></i> the "you-are-an-idiot-virus.html" file which sources all the other files from this repository <br>
<br>
<b>(see "source-code/readme.md" for more information on the source code)</b>
